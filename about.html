      <h2>A Legacy of Trust and Passion for Cycling</h2>
      <p>
        Long before Alf’s Cycles became a familiar name in the neighbourhood,
        there was simply Uncle Alf — a man, a workshop, and an unshakable love
        for bikes
      </p>
      <p>
        Alf didn’t see bicycles as just machines. To him, they were freedom,
        independence, and joy — a way to feel the world move beneath you. He
        spent his early years riding wherever the road would take him, learning
        every sound, scratch, and rhythm of a well-loved bike. Over time, fixing
        bikes became second nature, not as a job, but as an expression of care.
      </p>
      <p>
        What started as helping friends and neighbours soon grew into something
        bigger. Alf opened his shop with one simple intention: to share his
        passion with the community. He believed everyone — young or old,
        beginner or seasoned rider — deserved a bike that felt safe,
        comfortable, and truly theirs.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./images/alfs/alf-family.webp" alt="Alf's family" />
        <figcaption>Alf's family</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Uncle Alf was known for taking his time. He’d talk you through repairs,
        teach kids how to pump their tyres properly, and always insist that no
        question was a silly one. Many people remember him less as a shop owner
        and more as a familiar face — someone who genuinely wanted you to enjoy
        the ride.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the years passed, Alf’s Cycles became a place where stories were
        exchanged as often as parts were fitted. Children who bought their first
        bikes returned years later with families of their own. The shop grew,
        but Alf’s values never changed: honesty, craftsmanship, and community
        above all else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Alf’s Cycles continues in the spirit Uncle Alf started. Every
        bike we sell, every repair we make, and every conversation we have is
        guided by his belief that cycling is better when it’s shared.
