# Alf’s Cycles 🚲  
**MA Web Design & Content Management – University of Greenwich**

This project is a static marketing website created for **Alf’s Cycles**, a fictional neighbourhood bicycle shop. It was developed as part of the **MA in Web Design and Content Management** programme at the **University of Greenwich**.

The website focuses on storytelling, emotional connection, and clear content structure rather than sales or e-commerce functionality.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project was to design a calm, intentional, and emotionally engaging website that reflects the legacy and values of a long-standing local business.

Instead of encouraging users to buy products, the website invites them to slow down, explore, and connect with the brand’s story, craftsmanship, and community presence. The project emphasises content clarity, visual hierarchy, and user experience through thoughtful layout and typography.
